==== Test for Basic Lottery ====

All the files needed for the basic lottery scheduling (including test files) are in the directory case1. To run the first test for the basic lottery scheduling, type:

cc longrun.c
nice -n -20 ./a.out a 100 300000 >>test1 & nice -n 20 ./a.out b 100 300000 >>test1

The nice command will assign process a and process b 12 and 20 tickets, respectively. The results are stored in the file
test1. Then you can examine it in the way that we described in detail under the test section of the DESIGN document.

==== Test for Dynamic Lottery ====

All the files needed for the dynamic lottery (including test files) are in the directory case2. To run second test, type:

cc longrun2.c
./a.out 1 10000 20000 >>nul & ./a.out 2 10000 20000 >>nul & ./a.out 3 10000 20000 >>nul

The output file nul is just used to consume the screen's output information, so that you can examine the scheduler's output
information to check the scheduling algorithm's correctness.

==== Test for Our Own Design ====

ll the files needed for the dynamic lottery (including test files) are in the directory case2. To run second test, type:

1.
cc longrun2.c
./a.out 1 10000 20000 >>nul & ./b.out 2 10000 20000 >>nul

2.
cc longrun2.c
cc longrun3.c -o b.out
./a.out 1 10000 20000 >>nul & ./b.out 2 10000 20000 >>nul 

The output file nul is just used to consume the screen's output information, so that you can examine the scheduler's output
information to check the scheduling algorithm's correctness.
